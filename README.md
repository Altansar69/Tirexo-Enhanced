# Tirexo-Enhanced
Enhanced your experience at Tirexo
This script made for the site https://www.tirexo.work/ does several things.

credits: The idea of this script comes from the one made by RoyalGamer06 then taken by SubZeroPL for the rin. Thanks a lot to both of them.

## Features:
- Change the size (customizable) and color (customizable) of the "qualities", by default more the qualities of a file is good more the color will be blue (5 colors) and more it will be bad more it will be red.
- Change the color (customizable) and size (customizable) of the language (4 in total), 1 for VO (VOSTFR + VO), 1 for French (VF, Truefrench, VFSTFR, VFQ), 1 for Multi and 1 for other languages.
- change the size (customizable) of the "season"
- improves the title of the page. Exemple: 
by default: Télécharger The Expanse saison 2 COMPLETE ou voir en streaming gratuitement TVrip (VOSTFR) » Tirexo - 1er site de téléchargement direct francophone
now : The Expanse
- Hides the articles being in a bad quality (customizable). The quality is categorized in 5. Basically the 2 lowest quality are hidden but it is customizable. Obviously it is useless to change the color of the "very low" quality if it is to hide it.
- masks the articles being in certain languages (customizable). Disable by default.
- Delete the infobox encouraging you to change your DNS.
- redirects the fake tirexo site to the real one

All these options can be activated or deactivated by changing the tru or false at the initialization of the variables or at the beginning of the script.

## To add:
- search for VFQ
- delete the 90 days message (private message)
- comments
- options configurable from a button on the site
- infinite scrolling
